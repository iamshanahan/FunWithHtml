<p>First paragraph.</p>










<p>Second paragraph after many newlines, which are ignored.</p>

<p>This paragraph has many



invisible



newlines in the middle of it.</p>

<p>This paragraph has many     

    invisible

     This paragraph has many newlines and spaces at the beginning and the end.        



</p>


    Here is a block of text outside of any paragraph,     


    which has leading, trailing, and internal whitespace.     



<p>
In conclusion, paragraphs are separated by section breaks. Whitespace at the beginning, end, or between paragraphs is ignored. Entering and leaving a paragraph within a paragraph is treated like a new paragraph, both ways. Whitespace within a paragraph, or any block of text, is collapsed.
